# ESP8266_W132_mqtt

A ESP-8266 develompent board, which sents sensordata of a Ventus W132 via mqtt e.g. to HomeAssistant 
   sensors:
   * wind speed 
   * wind direction 
   * wind gust 
   * temperature 
   * and huminity
   to a mqtt-broker
 
   ToDo: connect 3 wires of ESP-8266 direct to the 3 wires of the 433 MHZ-sender 
   it is not neccesary to cut the wires,
   try to stripp a bit the isolation to soldering the wires of your ESP-8266.

  Your W132 does not need the batteries in its battery compartment, the W132 will get his power from the ESP-8266
